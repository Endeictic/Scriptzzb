Because of Roblox's new Anti-Cheat "Byfron".

#### Announcement from Krnl:

"Roblox process not found" & Byfron Explanation! 

Hello Krnl users, many of you have been badgering us about this "Roblox process not found" issue, and have been hearing things about Roblox's new anti cheat "Byfron" / "Hyperion", we will clarify a few things.

No, byfron is not out for everyone. - Some Roblox users have been forced onto the version that contains Byfron anti cheat and this is what is causing these issues.

Now this version of roblox is x64, regular Roblox & Krnl, and Roblox exploits in general all run on x32 version and aren't compatible with the x64 version so the injector isn't working with it.

The "fix" - this is a 3rd party fix, please ensure you follow these steps and these steps only to ensure your safety 
1.) Install a UserScript Manager (for most browsers: ViolentMonkey, https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/ or tampermonkey, https://www.tampermonkey.net/)

2.) Select your browser and install.

3.) Open link in your browser: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/956649076852654122/1089031453595148338/fix_channel_roblox.user.js

4.) Install it accordingly.

5.) After it has been installed you will need to Reinstall Roblox and reopen any Roblox browser tabs.
